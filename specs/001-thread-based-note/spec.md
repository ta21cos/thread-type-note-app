# Feature Specification: Thread-Based Note-Taking Application

**Feature Branch**: `001-thread-based-note`  
**Created**: 2025-09-07  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Thread-based note-taking application where users can create interconnected notes with replies, mentions, and tags, similar to social media threads but for personal knowledge management"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a knowledge worker, I want to create notes that can reference and reply to other notes, forming conversation-like threads, so that I can organize my thoughts and ideas in a connected, contextual manner similar to how discussions naturally evolve.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has no existing notes, **When** they create their first note, **Then** the note is saved and displayed as a standalone thread
2. **Given** a user is viewing an existing note, **When** they create a reply to that note, **Then** the reply appears nested under the original note maintaining the thread hierarchy
3. **Given** a user is composing a note, **When** they type "@" followed by text, **Then** they can select from existing notes to create a mention/reference
4. **Given** a user is composing a note, **When** they add hashtags, **Then** the tags are recognized and the note becomes findable through those tags
5. **Given** a user has multiple threaded notes, **When** they click on a mention or tag, **Then** they navigate to the referenced note or see all notes with that tag

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user deletes a note that has replies? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: should replies be deleted, orphaned, or promoted?]
- How does system handle circular references (Note A mentions Note B which mentions Note A)?
- What happens when searching for non-existent tags or mentions?
- How does the system handle very long threads? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: pagination, collapse, or infinite scroll?]

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to create text-based notes
- **FR-002**: System MUST enable users to reply to existing notes, creating a thread structure
- **FR-003**: System MUST support mentions using "@" syntax to reference other notes
- **FR-004**: System MUST support hashtags for categorizing and organizing notes
- **FR-005**: Users MUST be able to view notes in a threaded/nested format showing parent-child relationships
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide search functionality for finding notes by content, tags, or mentions
- **FR-007**: Users MUST be able to edit their own notes after creation
- **FR-008**: Users MUST be able to delete their own notes
- **FR-009**: System MUST persist all notes and their relationships [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: storage duration and backup requirements?]
- **FR-010**: System MUST display timestamps for when notes were created and last modified
- **FR-011**: System MUST handle [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: single user or multi-user system?]
- **FR-012**: System MUST support [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: maximum note length, thread depth limits?]
- **FR-013**: Notes MUST support [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: plain text only or rich text/markdown?]
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: export/import capabilities needed?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Note**: Represents a single piece of content that can be standalone or part of a thread. Contains text content, creation timestamp, modification timestamp, author information, and optional parent reference
- **Thread**: A collection of related notes organized hierarchically with parent-child relationships
- **Tag**: A categorization label prefixed with "#" that can be attached to notes for organization and discovery
- **Mention**: A reference from one note to another using "@" notation, creating explicit connections between notes
- **User**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: The person creating and managing notes - single user or multiple users with separate spaces?]
