# Feature Specification: Thread-Based Note-Taking Application

**Feature Branch**: `001-thread-based-note`  
**Created**: 2025-09-07  
**Status**: Ready  
**Input**: User description: "Thread-based note-taking application where users can create interconnected notes with replies, and mentions, similar to social media threads but for personal knowledge management"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a knowledge worker, I want to create notes that can reference and reply to other notes, forming conversation-like threads, so that I can organize my thoughts and ideas in a connected, contextual manner similar to how discussions naturally evolve.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has no existing notes, **When** they create their first note, **Then** the note is saved and displayed as a standalone thread
2. **Given** a user is viewing an existing note, **When** they create a reply to that note, **Then** the reply appears nested under the original note maintaining the thread hierarchy
3. **Given** a user has multiple notes, **Then** each note should show has a unique ID
4. **Given** a user has multiple notes, **When** they add @ + ID to a note, **Then** the note is mentioned in the note with the ID
6. **Given** a user has multiple threaded notes, **When** they click on a mention or tag, **Then** they navigate to the referenced note or see all notes with that tag
7. **Given** a user has multiple notes, **When** they search for a note, **Then** they can find it by content, or mentions
8. **Given** a user has multiple notes, **Then** they can see the latest note at the bottom of the list
9. **Given** a user has multiple notes, **When** they scroll to the top of the list, **Then** the oldest note is at the top (infinite scroll)
10. **Given** a user has multiple notes, **When** they clicked on a note, **Then** they can see the note's threads in the right half of the screen
11. **Given** a user has multiple notes, **When** they delete a note, **Then** the note and all its replies are deleted
12. **Given** a user has multiple notes, **When** they add a tag to a note, **Then** the note is findable through that tag
13. **Given** a user has multiple notes, **When** circular references are created, **Then** the system should handle them gracefully
14. **Given** a user has multiple notes, **When** they search for non-existent note ID, **Then** the system doesn't show any results
15. **Given** a user is composing a note, **When** they typed very long note, **Then** the note should not be saved
16. **Given** a user has multiple notes, **When** the system is under heavy load, **Then** the system should handle it gracefully
17. **Given** a user has multiple notes, **When** the system is under heavy load, **Then** the system should handle it gracefully
18. **Given** a user has multiple notes, **When** the system is under heavy load, **Then** the system should handle it gracefully
19. **Given** a user has multiple notes, **When** the system is under heavy load, **Then** the system should handle it gracefully
20. **Given** a user has multiple notes, **When** the system is under heavy load, **Then** the system should handle it gracefully


## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to create text-based (markdown) notes
- **FR-002**: System MUST enable users to reply to existing notes, creating a thread structure
- **FR-003**: System MUST support mentions using "@" + note ID syntax to reference other notes
- **FR-004**: Users MUST be able to view notes in a threaded/nested format showing parent-child relationships
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide search functionality for finding notes by content, or mentions
- **FR-007**: Users MUST be able to edit their own notes after creation
- **FR-008**: Users MUST be able to delete their own notes
- **FR-009**: System MUST persist all notes and their relationships
- **FR-010**: System MUST display timestamps for when notes were created and last modified
- **FR-011**: System MUST have unique IDs for each note and enable users to copy them
- **FR-012**: System MUST enforce maximum note length limits
- **FR-013**: Notes MUST support markdown formatting
- **FR-014**: System MUST display notes in split view (list on left, thread on right)
- **FR-015**: System MUST display notes chronologically (oldest at top, newest at bottom)
- **FR-016**: System MUST implement infinite scroll for note lists
- **FR-017**: System MUST cascade delete replies when parent note is deleted
- **FR-018**: System MUST handle circular references gracefully
- **FR-019**: System MUST return no results for non-existent note ID searches
- **FR-020**: System MUST handle system load gracefully with performance degradation

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Note**: Represents a single piece of content that can be standalone or part of a thread. Contains unique ID, markdown text content, creation timestamp, modification timestamp, and optional parent reference
- **Thread**: A collection of related notes organized hierarchically with parent-child relationships
- **Mention**: A reference from one note to another using "@" + ID notation, creating explicit connections between notes
- **User**: The person creating and managing notes (single-user system)
